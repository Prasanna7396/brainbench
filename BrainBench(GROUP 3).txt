Question 63:
public class BrainBench
{

A. Factory
B. Prototype
C. Proxy
D. Builder
E.Singleton

ANSWER: E

 The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a particular class is created per application.
 This pattern is useful where only one object instance is required, for example, while connecting to a database using only one object that manages the connection.
 Too many database connection objects are not only difficult to maintain, but also are adverse to performance.


64.what is the difference between stringbuffer and stringbuilder class?

C. StringBuffer cannot be passed to the print() method PrintWriter Interface,StringBuilder can be passed
D. stringBuilder class implements builder design pattern but StringBuffer do not
E. StringBuffer supports unicode characters,StringBuilder only supports ASCII

ANSWER: A
(StringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object . 
The object created through StringBuffer is stored in the heap.
StringBuffer has the same methods as the StringBuilder , but each method in StringBuffer is synchronized that is StringBuffer is thread safe )

81.You are deploying an application via java web start. The JAR files are signed. You want the client to get full system access, 
when trusted by the user Referring to the scenario above what will you do to the JNLP file? 
 ANSWER:  <security>
		<all-permissions/>
	</security>
	(Apply the following guidelines to help secure your RIAs(RICH INTERNET APPLICATIONS)
                   Sign the JAR file of the RIA with a certificate from a recognized certificate authority. For more information, see the Signing and Verifying JAR Files topic.
                   If the RIA requires access outside of the security sandbox, specify the all-permissions element in the JNLP file for the RIA.
	 Otherwise, let the RIA default to running in the security sandbox. The ABOVE code snippet shows the all-permissions element in the RIA's JNLP file.)
